### Overview
A pipeline for systematic operon analysis (soa) in aims to elucidate genome wide transcription regulatory networks by using a comparative genomics approach to discover motifs that are implicated in the regulation of one or more operon(s). The distance between two operons in "regulon space" is determined as the pairwise distnace between their regulatory motifs. A graphical network where the operons are nodes and the distance between any two nodes (i.e. operons) is defined by the distance of their motifs provides insight to the global regulatory network.

This core comparative genomics of this pipeline is a modified, high throughput, version of the pipeline designed for operon_conserve.
